## Description

This is a Next.js app that I am building for my sister as an excuse to do a side project to learn Next.js, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and Styled Components. I am following the tutorial by "Coding With David" on YouTube. The tutorial link is: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTFXufTgfOE&t=1191s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dTFXufTgfOE&t=1191s)
